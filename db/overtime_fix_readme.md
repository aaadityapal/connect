# Overtime Approval System Fix

This document explains the fixes implemented to address issues with duplicate entries and incorrect status persistence in the overtime approval system.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate entries after approval**:
   - When approving overtime, two entries appeared in the table
   - This was caused by duplicate data between `overtime_notification` and `overtime_notifications` tables

2. **Rejected entries reappearing as "Submitted"**:
   - After rejecting an entry, it still showed up with "Submitted" status
   - Required multiple rejections before it disappeared
   - Only disappeared permanently when approved

3. **Status not updating in attendance table**:
   - After approval/rejection, the status in the attendance table remained "Submitted"
   - The UI showed "Submitted" even though the action was completed
   - This was caused by the API endpoint not properly updating the specific attendance record

4. **Original overtime message being overwritten**:
   - When approving or rejecting overtime, the original message was replaced with "Your overtime has been approved/rejected"
   - This caused loss of the original message submitted by the employee
   - The message should remain unchanged during the approval process

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed the API Endpoint (`api/update_overtime_status.php`)

- Completely rewritten to use a more targeted approach for updating records
- Now finds the specific attendance record by ID before updating it
- Uses prepared statements for better security and reliability
- Adds extensive error logging to help diagnose issues
- Ensures both the attendance table and notifications table are in sync
- Preserves the original message in the overtime_notifications table when updating status

### 2. Enhanced JavaScript UI Updates

- Improved the `updateUIWithoutReload` function to better handle status updates
- Added visual feedback when status changes (temporary highlight)
- Created a new `updateDataInMemory` function to ensure in-memory data is consistent
- Enhanced the `updateLocalData` function with object refresh to prevent stale data
- Added extensive debug logging to help diagnose issues
- Added safeguards to preserve the original overtime message in the UI

### 3. Created Data Fix Utilities

- `fix_overtime_status.php`: Script to fix inconsistencies between tables
- Identifies and corrects records where attendance status doesn't match notification status
- Sets default values for NULL or empty status fields
- Provides detailed reporting of all changes made

### 4. Normalized Status Handling

- Added validation of status values in `formatAttendanceData` function
- Ensures only valid status values are used: 'approved', 'rejected', 'submitted', 'pending'
- Defaults to 'pending' for any invalid status values
- Consistent status handling across all parts of the system

## How to Use

1. Run the fix script to correct existing data:
   ```
   php db/fix_overtime_status.php
   ```

2. Test the overtime approval system to ensure it's working correctly:
   - Approve and reject overtime entries
   - Verify the status updates correctly in the UI
   - Check the database to ensure both tables are in sync
   - Confirm that original messages are preserved after approval/rejection

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the error logs for any PHP errors
2. Open browser developer tools to view JavaScript console logs
3. Verify database tables structure is correct
4. Ensure database user has proper permissions to update records

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains all existing data and functionality
- It's backward compatible with existing code
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot any remaining issues
- If you encounter any issues, check the error logs for details

## Technical Details

The root causes were:

1. Having two similarly named tables:
   - `overtime_notification` (singular)
   - `overtime_notifications` (plural)

2. The API endpoint was only looking for records with 'submitted' status, but some records might have 'pending' status

3. The status update logic in JavaScript wasn't properly handling the status change

The fix standardizes on the plural version (`overtime_notifications`), ensures proper status tracking, and adds additional validation to prevent inconsistencies.
