DATABASE AND FORM UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

We've made several changes to make the Work Progress and Inventory forms work properly:

1. ADDED MISSING FIELDS:
   - Added 'work_type' field to the event_work_progress table
   - Renamed 'item_name' to 'material' in the event_inventory_items table

2. UPDATED PHP PROCESSING CODE:
   - Modified the work progress handler to use the new work_type field
   - Updated the inventory handler to use 'material' instead of 'item_name'
   - Added fallback logic to accept either field name during the transition

3. CREATED MAINTENANCE SCRIPTS:
   - install_tables.php: Creates all required tables if they don't exist
   - update_form_fields.php: Adds/renames fields on existing tables

NEXT STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES
=====================================

1. First, make sure your database connection is working by visiting:
   http://localhost/hr/debug_form.php

2. If you haven't already created the tables, run:
   http://localhost/hr/install_tables.php

3. If you already had the tables but needed field updates, run:
   http://localhost/hr/update_form_fields.php

4. Test your form with the debug tool to ensure it works correctly

5. Update your form's HTML to match the field names:
   - Make sure the work type field in your form has name="work_type[]"
   - Make sure the material field has name="material[]" (instead of item_name)
