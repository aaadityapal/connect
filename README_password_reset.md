# Password Reset Functionality

This document provides an overview of the password reset functionality implemented in the ArchitectsHive system.

## Files Created

1. `reset_password_modal.php` - Contains the UI for the password reset modal
2. `js/reset_password.js` - JavaScript functionality for the password reset modal

## How It Works

1. A "Forgot your password?" link has been added to the login page
2. When clicked, it displays a modal with the password reset form
3. The modal can also be triggered by adding `?reset_password=true` to the login page URL
4. The process has two steps:
   - Step 1: User enters their email address to receive a reset link
   - Step 2: User enters and confirms their new password

## Current Implementation

The current implementation is UI-only. The backend functionality will need to be developed separately.

### To Complete the Backend Implementation:

1. Modify `reset_password_modal.php` to handle form submissions
2. Create a secure token generation system for password reset links
3. Implement email sending functionality
4. Add token verification and password update logic

## Design Notes

The password reset UI follows the existing design language of the application, featuring:
- Consistent color scheme with the login page
- Animated elements for better user experience
- Password strength indicator
- Password matching verification
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Usage

To test the current UI implementation:
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click on "Forgot your password?" link
3. The modal will appear with the email form
4. Enter any email to see the success message
5. The second step (new password form) will appear automatically

## Security Considerations for Backend Implementation

When implementing the backend functionality, consider the following security measures:
- Generate cryptographically secure tokens with expiration
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Validate email addresses before sending reset links
- Enforce strong password requirements
- Log all password reset attempts for security monitoring
